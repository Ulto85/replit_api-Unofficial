### What is it?
The replit API is a simple webscraping library which allows you to get information from replit
### How to use
```python

print(replit.user_cycle_search('USER'))
print(replit.user_description('USER'))
print(replit.user_most_recent_post('USER'))
print(replit.user_most_recent_comment('USER'))

```
This returns the amount of cycles a user has, the description, most recent post, and the comment.
